In my memory this whole Orb arc was a lot shorter, and perhaps the sense of inevitability is a part of that - somewhat like last episode, this episode showed events playing themselves out that felt to have already been firmly set in motion. The council meeting in the cold open shows something of a decision, but even that is very much the only possible decision that the characters (being generous to our new antagonist) in question could make.


Deakka has often struck me as an underused character; his story is much the same as that of our leads, but given far less attention. This episode jumps the gun a little - there's no need to explain why he'd want to shoot down Earth Federation forces - but his clear sympathy for the Archangel is intriguing, even if it seems to be more a mix of Stockholm syndrome and simping for Millie than any deep political conversion. Still, he's not the only character who seems to be thinking with his genitals.

I always expected this rewatch to be a long-term project, but life has gotten in the way a little more than I expected. I hope that coming back to this as someone who's emigrated to Japan will inform the project - both in terms of improved Japanese, and in terms divided loyalties - but I must admit nothing seems particularly different yet.
