Last episode was a welcome attack not just on war but on the causes of war - in particular, on the overconfidence of an older generation that thinks it knows what's best for the world. Gundam made a passionate case not just against fighting but against militarism; as this episode emphasises, our heroes are now seen as deserters, spies, or worse.

Athrun follows on in this tradition: cautious, uncertain, emotional but never without cause. His physical injury aligns perfectly with his vulnerable state; moments like drawing a gun on his childhood toy should be absurd, but he has enough gravitas to carry them off. Between a crazed father, a traitorous fiancée, his friends killed and himself injured, I felt a lot of sympathy for the poor kid trying to do the right thing. And as the conclusion of the episode shows, it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.

Sadly, this isn't remotely matched by his counterparts. Kira's hesitation at the end of the last episode - much less his crybaby attitude from earlier - is completely gone, replaced by an unwavering confidence as he asks Ramius and La Flaga what they plan to do. While a near-death experience can justify a certain amount of personality change, there's no such excuse for Lacus, who ping-pongs between painful naïveté and impossible foreknowledge. I guess the idea is that her straightforward approach lets her see the fundamental truths of things, but the elaborate plots she must have run to pilfer new robots rather undermine that. For me, her cast-iron certainty is recapitulating the same flaw that has lead to this whole war: she thinks she knows better than the rest of her people, and is willing to cheat and steal and undermine to advance her cause.

Look at that smug grin. Would you buy a used car from this woman?
