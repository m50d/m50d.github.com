Last episode was a welcome attack not just on war but on the causes of war - in particular, on the overconfidence of an older generation that thinks it knows what's best for the world. Gundam made a passionate case not just against fighting but against militarism; as this episode emphasises, our heroes are now seen as deserters, spies, or worse.

Athrun follows on in this tradition: cautious, uncertain, emotional but never without cause. His physical injury aligns perfectly with his vulnerable state; moments like drawing a gun on his childhood toy should be absurd, but he has enough gravitas to carry them off. Between a crazed father, a traitorous fianc√©e, his friends killed and himself injured, I felt a lot of sympathy for the poor kid trying to do the right thing. And as the conclusion of the episode shows, it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.

Sadly, this isn't remotely matched by his counterparts.
