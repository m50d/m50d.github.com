## Opening match (Special rookie tag match)

This was great. I actually enjoyed this more than a lot of the matches higher up the card, though it probably helped that a) I had no real expectations going into it b) I'm a huge Suzume fan.

Seriously, though, she was glorious here; she's shaping up to be a great wrestler, and her new ring gear looks absolutely brilliant, with little bee wings on the skirt and embroidered details on the stockings. Shiori Sena is shaping up fast as well, and Miyamoto Moka thankfully laid off on the closed-fist punches that annoyed me in soom of her earlier matches. I don't want to go on about "exposing the business", but for me it really undermines the great forearm strikes that some of the top people do (particularly Sakazaki Yuka) if you've got someone on the roster just straight-up punching people.

It sounds like faint praise, but this match really just nailed the basics of tag team storytelling: the ebb and flow, the hot tags, all the cliches of wrestling that make for a classic match. Suzume, gradually worn down by more powerful opponents, desparately going to the top rope, betting it all, was pretty much a perfect finish; she got the win, but it felt like it could very easily have gone the other way. This was a real gem of a match.

## Tag team match

Ugh. The less said about this the better really. Kiryu Mahiro was the first TJPW match I ever saw, and I've hated her ever since - it doesn't help that her gimmick invites a comparison to Sakazaki Yuka that she can never live up to. There are blander gimmicks, worse technical wrestlers, poorer good sellers, but I don't think anyone else on the roster manages the same complete package of blandness that she does. And if anyone comes close it's Neko Haruna, who was also in this match.

I can't point to any specifically bad moments, but there was just nothing interesting here. Pom normally manages to elevate matches she's involved in, but she didn't do her "flying" move and her usually good selling wasn't in evidence. I remember that Mahiro won, but I honestly can't remember the finish or, really, anything about this match. Meh.
