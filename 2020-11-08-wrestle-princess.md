I was at Wrestle Princess yesterday, and it felt like enough of an occasion that I wanted to record my thoughts. I'm not a serious critic and I don't have a whole lot of technical knowledge of wrestling, so this is purely a personal account.

## Opening match (Special rookie tag match)

This was great. I actually enjoyed this more than a lot of the matches higher up the card, though it probably helped that a) I had no real expectations going into it b) I'm a huge Suzume fan.

Seriously, though, she was glorious here; she's shaping up to be a great wrestler, and her new ring gear looks absolutely brilliant, with little bee wings on the skirt and embroidered details on the stockings. Shiori Sena is shaping up fast as well, and Miyamoto Moka thankfully laid off on the closed-fist punches that annoyed me in soom of her earlier matches. I don't want to go on about "exposing the business", but for me it really undermines the great forearm strikes that some of the top people do (particularly Sakazaki Yuka) if you've got someone on the roster just straight-up punching people.

It sounds like faint praise, but this match really just nailed the basics of tag team storytelling: the ebb and flow, the hot tags, all the cliches of wrestling that make for a classic match. Suzume, gradually worn down by more powerful opponents, desparately going to the top rope, betting it all, was pretty much a perfect finish; she got the win, but it felt like it could very easily have gone the other way. This was a real gem of a match.

## Tag team match

Ugh. The less said about this the better really. Kiryu Mahiro was the first TJPW match I ever saw, and I've hated her ever since - it doesn't help that her gimmick invites a comparison to Sakazaki Yuka that she can never live up to. There are blander gimmicks, worse technical wrestlers, poorer good sellers, but I don't think anyone else on the roster manages the same complete package of blandness that she does. And if anyone comes close it's Neko Haruna, who was also in this match.

I can't point to any specifically bad moments, but there was just nothing interesting here. Pom normally manages to elevate matches she's involved in, but she didn't do her "flying" move and her usually good selling wasn't in evidence. I remember that Mahiro won, but I honestly can't remember the finish or, really, anything about this match. Meh.

## International Princess championship semi-final round

This was outstanding, although it was the narrative rather than the wrestling that made it shine. I couldn't tell you a whole lot about what moves were used when or where, but Hikari Noa felt like a credible badass right from her entrance with that assassin-style perch on the corner. Maiumi Mirai has always been someone who I respect but don't really enjoy, but she was on fine form yesterday: she has power and grit in spades, but it wasn't enough. After the finish she was crying and pounding the ring and it felt earned; she gave it her all, to the point that she couldn't even walk backstage. It was the kind of match that elevates both competitors, and they got the right result. Good job!

## International Princess championship semi-final round

I was happy with this semi-final too, although I think it mostly served to dig TJPW out of a hole they'd booked themselves into. Nakajima Shoko was, frankly, far too good for this tournament, but Kamifuku Yuki has the sheer size advantage that let her credibly win without damaging Shoko too much.

And while I'm usually pretty hard on Yuki, she raised her game here: in place of her usual eyepokes she managed a suplex and a
