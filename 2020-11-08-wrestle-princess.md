I was at Wrestle Princess yesterday, and it felt like enough of an occasion that I wanted to record my thoughts. I'm not a serious critic and I don't have a whole lot of technical knowledge of wrestling, so this is purely a personal account.

## Opening match (Special rookie tag match)

This was great. I actually enjoyed this more than a lot of the matches higher up the card, though it probably helped that a) I had no real expectations going into it b) I'm a huge Suzume fan.

Seriously, though, she was glorious here; she's shaping up to be a great wrestler, and her new ring gear looks absolutely brilliant, with little bee wings on the skirt and embroidered details on the stockings. Shiori Sena is shaping up fast as well, and Miyamoto Moka thankfully laid off on the closed-fist punches that annoyed me in soom of her earlier matches. I don't want to go on about "exposing the business", but for me it really undermines the great forearm strikes that some of the top people do (particularly Sakazaki Yuka) if you've got someone on the roster just straight-up punching people.

It sounds like faint praise, but this match really just nailed the basics of tag team storytelling: the ebb and flow, the hot tags, all the cliches of wrestling that make for a classic match. Suzume, gradually worn down by more powerful opponents, desparately going to the top rope, betting it all, was pretty much a perfect finish; she got the win, but it felt like it could very easily have gone the other way. This was a real gem of a match.

## Tag team match

Ugh. The less said about this the better really. Kiryu Mahiro was the first TJPW match I ever saw, and I've hated her ever since - it doesn't help that her gimmick invites a comparison to Sakazaki Yuka that she can never live up to. There are blander gimmicks, worse technical wrestlers, poorer good sellers, but I don't think anyone else on the roster manages the same complete package of blandness that she does. And if anyone comes close it's Neko Haruna, who was also in this match.

I can't point to any specifically bad moments, but there was just nothing interesting here. Pom normally manages to elevate matches she's involved in, but she didn't do her "flying" move and her usually good selling wasn't in evidence. I remember that Mahiro won, but I honestly can't remember the finish or, really, anything about this match. Meh.

## International Princess championship semi-final round

This was outstanding, although it was the narrative rather than the wrestling that made it shine. I couldn't tell you a whole lot about what moves were used when or where, but Hikari Noa felt like a credible badass right from her entrance with that assassin-style perch on the corner. Maiumi Mirai has always been someone who I respect but don't really enjoy, but she was on fine form yesterday: she has power and grit in spades, but it wasn't enough. After the finish she was crying and pounding the ring and it felt earned; she gave it her all, to the point that she couldn't even walk backstage. It was the kind of match that elevates both competitors, and they got the right result. Good job!

## International Princess championship semi-final round

I was happy with this semi-final too, although I think it mostly served to dig TJPW out of a hole they'd booked themselves into. Nakajima Shoko was, frankly, far too good for this tournament, but Kamifuku Yuki has the sheer size advantage that let her credibly win without damaging Shoko too much.

And while I'm usually pretty hard on Yuki, she raised her game here: in place of her usual eyepokes she managed a suplex and a... reverse DDT? I think? As you can tell, I don't know a lot of wrestling moves, but she was clearly doing wrestling moves and this felt like a proper wrestling match, in a way that I honestly haven't seen from her before. When she got the win there was an audible gasp from the crowd, but it didn't feel like Shoko was robbed; it felt like Yuki had earned this one.

## Special singles match

I'd genuinely forgotten this one until I looked up the card, and I'm actually a fan of both wrestlers involved. I'm glad to see Manase Yuna coming back, but there just wasn't enough build to make me care about this for story reasons, and the wrestling action was nothing special either.

Raku's problem is that she doesn't have the tools to credibly threaten someone bigger and stronger. I love the "sneaky" direction she's taken (genuinely), but running in for a surprise rollup isn't enough to win big matches (and nor should it be). She doesn't have any real power moves (her chop is sometimes treated that way, but not consistently) and she's not a high-flier, so it's really hard to see her ever beating someone like Yuna. Coming hot on the heels of a Nakajima Shoko match made this painfully apparent; Shoko is a model for what Raku could become, but she's only credible against bigger opponents because she also does high-flying stuff when she needs to.

Yuna won, and under other circumstances I'd say that's not what TJPW should be doing with guests from other promotions, but the real problem is not this match, it's that Raku doesn't really have a path forward. I'd hoped teaming with Itoh Maki would give her a chance to learn and improve, but apparently not. So it was hard to get invested in this match, simply because the outcome was never really in doubt.

## Special rule swapping singles match

So I'd been skeptical about this match from the point where DDT asked for rule suggestions from the fans - while it's good to get the fans involved, it also seems like not having enough ideas of their own. The way I'd assumed this was going to work was that the stipulations would somehow be in Hyper Misao's favour, helping her overcome Saki Akai's natural advantages and leading to a more balanced match.

That... didn't happen. What we got was half comedy match and half beatdown; while there were a couple of good punchlines (both agreeing to move on from the dizzy rules; Akai watching and waiting for Misao to finish eating before just pushing the button), there was, again, never really any point where it looked like things might go differently. The "last man standing" section was particularly bad; Akai would knock Misao down, and then we'd wait to see if she eventually got up, and eventually she did it enough times that Misao stayed down for the count. The partners section also seemed particularly wasteful; I'd have loved to see a full intergender tag match, but going to the trouble of bringing in two (presumably high-ranking?) guys from DDT so that you can have them fight for a couple of minutes before you push a button and move on felt more sad than anything else.

I'm a *lot* more hyped for the return of Saki-sama next week; that at least has the potential to mean something. This wasn't interesting in storyline and it wasn't interesting as a match.

## Special tag team match

And completing the trifecta of matches where the outcome was never in doubt, we have this. From the moment this was first announced I couldn't understand the team setup: Itoh Maki has not been (at least until now) a credible threat to Yamashita Miyu, and it's hard to imagine Sareee giving Aja Kong any real trouble. Flip the teams and you've got something a lot more interesting on the face of it. Still, I trusted TJPW to come up with a way to even the odds.

And... nope. Nothing. Maki went toe-to-toe with Miyu for a while, something she's not been presented as capable of before, and so that did feel kind of elevating. But when Aja was in the ring, neither Saree nor Maki could really get anywhere - which is absolutely how Aja has to be booked, but is pretty limiting when you put her alongside TJPW's ace. The one moment where this match rose to the level it should have been was Itoh smashing her head with Aja's bin - letting her finally take down the monster - but this sadly led nowhere. There was an effort at interesting team dynamics, with Itoh calling out to Sareee to take care of Aja - but instead of telling a story of the effectiveness of teamwork, this just lead to the match breaking down into two single contests, which has the fundamental problem of my first paragraph: neither outcome is in doubt, and since the same team is winning both matchups, there's no reason for Aja and Miyu to do anything except sit back and collect the win.

Unlike the last two this was actually a pretty fun match, perhaps because of the larger-than-life characters involved, perhaps because there were moments where it genuinely felt like Itoh might manage an upset victory over Miyu. So if the aim was to elevate Itoh towards becoming a true main-eventer then this wasn't a total waste. But it was an incredibly frustrating match to watch, because it felt like it would have been so easy to have done something more interesting.

## International princess championship tournament final round

At this point I was guessing that they wanted to put the belt on Yuki (partly for the out-of-ring reason of her English skills). Hikari's semi-final had been a drawn-out slog against the powerful Mirai, which seemed like a perfect way to overcome the biggest problem with having Yuki win here: looking at their semi-final matches Hikari was clearly the better athlete and the better wrestler. So I was expecting to see an exhausted Hikari drawing on every last ounce of her reserves, but ultimately failing against the bigger, fresher woman.

That... didn't really happen. Hikari came out looking every bit the badass she'd been in her first match, any aftereffects forgotten. Yuki managed a few moves and one genuinely impressive dropkick, but was very much not on her level. And then she got the win. In this situation I'd actually have preferred an eyepoke, or some other dastardly heel tactic; of course upsets happen in sports, but one of the advantages of being scripted is that in wrestling narratives most things happen for a reason. Finish aside this was actually a pretty good match, but it's hard to escape things feeling a bit forced.

## Princess tag championship match

This match became a lot more fun once I accepted Watanabe Miu as a power wrestler. It doesn't make any sense - she's about half the size of either of the Bakuretsu Sisters - but
