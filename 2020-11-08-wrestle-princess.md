## Opening match

This was great. I actually enjoyed this more than a lot of the matches higher up the card, though it probably helped that a) I had pretty low expectations b) I'm a huge Suzume fan.

Seriously, though, she was glorious here; she's shaping up to be a great wrestler, and her new ring gear looks absolutely brilliant, with little bee wings on the skirt and embroidered details on the stockings. Shiori Sena is shaping up fast as well, and Miyamoto Moka thankfully seems to be laying off on the closed-fist punches that annoyed me in her earlier matches.

It sounds like faint praise, but this match really just nailed the basics of tag team storytelling: the ebb and flow, the hot tags, it was all there, and these rules are classic
