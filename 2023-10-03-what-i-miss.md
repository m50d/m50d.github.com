I spent four years working for a major investment bank on a system that was, essentially, [Bank Python](https://calpaterson.com/bank-python.html), even though in our case it was actually Scala. While on the whole I'm probably happier in my current position, there's definitely a lot I miss from those days - some of it true for any large company, some of it true for any bank, and some of it true for any institution using that deployment model.
