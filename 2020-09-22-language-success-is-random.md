For the past 10 years I've been making my career in language X. I thought - and still think - that language X is the best language going. I thought - but no longer think - that this mattered. And facing the prospect of working in less-good languages for years has made me look on previous experiences with fresh eyes, and wonder how little language success has to do with language design.

Language X offers an unbeatable combination of features, but there were always a few weird points. It started as an extension/replacement for Language W, which has a first-rate build tool (Build Tool B), yet introductions always pushed people to use Build Tool D instead. It started with a pretty solid integration with IDE E, then shifted towards IDE F, then shifted again to emphasise non-IDE G.
